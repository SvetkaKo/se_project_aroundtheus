## Key learning

_Working on the "Around The U.S." project was incredibly rewarding. As the project grew, so did my skills.

Using BEM helped keep my CSS organized and easy to manage, which really simplified updating styles and debugging. Learning about form validation not only improved the project but also deepened my understanding of critical web development practices.

Overall, this project not only sharpened my technical abilities but also boosted my confidence in creating user-friendly websites. It was a dynamic learning experience that mirrored the evolution of the project itself._
